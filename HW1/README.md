# HW1 Q3 code 

This is the readme for running python code created for ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS (CS_325_400_W2019) HW1 question 3

## Getting Started
---
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to run the project on engineering server.

### Prerequisites

- Input Text file ('data.txt') The text file containing information to create arrays to run the program, example is included in zip.
first integer in line represents size of array (aka # of integers listed in text line) 

For example in 'data.txt'
```
10 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
3 8 8 8
8 1 3 4 1 4 7 3 5
```
Results (ouput) in txt file
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
8 8 8
1 1 3 3 4 4 5 7
```
## Deployment
----
        
1) Create and place text file containing arrays to be sorted in same folder as scripts

2) Run program of choice in cmd line. example:  `python mergesort.py "data.txt" `
If no filename is given on the command line, the program will try to read default file name in folder called 'data.txt'

3) Output results will be saved in same folder as either 'merge.txt' or 'insert.txt' depending on which program is run.   

## Built With
---
